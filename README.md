# CS124-final-project
Algorithm to do haplotype assembly

IMPORTANT: 
My code will only work with 100% accuracy if there are an adequate amount of reads per column (10 on average).
For the test matrices provided by Michael, each column only averages 6 reads, so there will probably be errors in my output (for high error rate in reads).
